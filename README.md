# Intro to Deployment
A workshop for the Code Fellows Intro to Computer Science and Web Development Bootcamp

Building a basic static server with Node.js and Express, and deploying via Heroku

## Before the Workshop
You'll need to have Node installed on your computer. You'll also need a Heroku account, and the Heroku Toolbelt installed (Heroku is the cloud platform we'll be using to deploy your app to the world).

#### Mac Users
- First, install Homebrew. Homebrew is a package manager that will help you install Node (and other packages in the future). Go to http://brew.sh/ and follow the directions at the bottom.
- Next, install Node. Type this in your Terminal: `brew install node`
- Check that Node is installed. Type this in your Terminal: `node -v` It should respond with the version number, like `v0.10.32`
- Set up Heroku (see below)

#### Linux Users
- You already have a lovely package manager, called apt. Congrats! 
- To install Node, we're going to have you compile it from the source file, rather than using apt. This will mean a smoother ride down the road. Go to http://fsje.codefellows.org/setup/install_node_from_source.html and follow the instructions. (While you're at it, thank Tyler Morgan and Ivan Storck, who wrote that book.)
- Check that Node is installed. Type this in your Terminal: `node -v` It should respond with the version number, like `v0.10.32`
- Set up Heroku (see below)

#### Everyone
- Go to  https://signup.heroku.com/identity and sign up for a free Heroku account. It will send you a confirmation email; be sure to follow the directions in that email to set your password and confirm your account.
- Download the Heroku Toolbelt. Follow the instructions here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up
- Check to make sure Heroku is installed by logging in, if you haven't already. Type this in your terminal and follow the directions: `heroku login`


## What We'll Do in the Workshop 
- Learn Node basics: what is it, how to write code for it, and how to install packages using npm
- Create a static server using Node and Express
- Deploy your site locally
- Deploy to Heroku and share your project with the world!
